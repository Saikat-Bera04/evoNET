# **App Name**: EvoNFT

## Core Features:

- Wallet Connection: Connect to Celo wallet for authentication.

Use generative AI to analyze user preferences and NFT attributes, and make the recommendation accordingly. Incorporate a LLM tool that analyzes new NFT releases or collections.
- Documentation Generation Tool: Automatically generate documentation, guides, and educational materials about Dynamic NFTs, the platform's technology, and future plans using AI.
